## ãƒ¾(ãƒ»ãƒ») Oh, hey! I'm Marine.

A developer who got into programming because it's fun!

ðŸ’» I build web apps for a living (and sometimes for fun) â€“ mostly with TypeScript. <br/>
ðŸ“± I have some experience with mobile development, primarily using React Native and Expo. <br/>
ðŸŽ® I enjoy exploring game development from time to time.

What excites me most? The challenge of problem-solving and the joy of bringing ideas to life!

In my free time, I love drawing, hiking, and exploring the outdoors. I also enjoy learning music, playing board games, or a nice indie game. ðŸ‘¾

Always curious, always learning. ðŸš€
